# Go wiki

A super simple wiki implementation from [Writing Web Applications](http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/). This is only a workout for me to learn Go syntax and the taste of its standard libraries.

A few more features in addition to the tutorial.

- Custom template functions
- Markdown for content
- Nested templates
- Static file serving
- Bootstrap theme

## Installation

1. Install Go, Node.js and bower.
2. Pull this repository.
3. `cd public` and `bower install` for front-end libraries.
